# Why is it so important to reduce global CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050? (Key Data Points You Have To Understand)

And why should you take action in the decarbonization and the energy transition.

## CO2 emissions are causing our atmosphere, land, and oceans to warm at an unprecedented rate

* CO2 emissions are accumulating in our atmosphere, remain between 300 - 1,000 Years, and the changes in atmospheric composition are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect causing global warming. <sub>_[Source 1]_</sub> 

* **2019 atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than at any time in the last 2 million years**  
Global Average CO2 Concentrations have increased to 410 ppm in 2019 from 280 ppm (parts per million) in 1850 (representing pre-industrial comparison period). [[Source]] 

* **The current rate of global warming is unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years**
Global Average Surface Temperature was 1.09°C  higher in 2011-2020 than in 1850-1900. 

## If C02 emissions remain at current levels until 2050 (which will be difficult as energy demand is expected to increase), and only then decline substantially before 2081-2100, then Global Average Surface Temperature is still projected to increase by 2.1°C - 3.5°C
Global warming of 2.5°C higher than baseline hasn’t occurred in over 3 million years.

### Higher degrees of warming will result in accelerating the frequency/severity of extreme changes in the global climate system, many of which are irreversible for centuries to millennia, including (but not limited to)…

* **More frequent/severe droughts projected in all inhabited continents except Asia**
At 1.5°C warming, hot extreme temperature events that occurred once in 50 years on average will be 8.6x as likely and 2°C hotter. At 4°C warming, they will be 39.2x as likely at 5.3°C hotter.

* **More frequent/intense heavy precipitation and associated flooding projected in most regions in Africa and Asia, North America, and Europe**
At 1.5°C warming, heavy 1-day precipitation events that occurred once in 10 years on average will be 1.5x as frequent and 10.5% wetter. At 4°C warming, they will be 2.7x as likely and 30.2% wetter.

* **More permafrost thawing and loss of seasonal snow cover, and of land ice and Arctic sea ice**
Global glaciers have retreated at a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years, and in 2010-2020 Artic sea ice reached its lowest level since at least 1850.

* **Greater deep-ocean acidification and deoxygenation, irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales**
The acidification of the ocean is unusual for the last 2 million years. Also, oceans mean sea level increased by 0.2M between 1901-2018, a faster rate than any preceding century in at least the last 3,000 years.

* **More frequent/severe coastal erosion and associated flooding**
Extreme sea level events that occurred once per 100 years in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100. 

* **Projected risk is high that a large percentage of species will face extinction**
Indicated by the observation that previous natural climate change that occurred at rates lower than current man-made climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Most plant species cannot shift their geographical ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with rates of climate change, marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels, higher ocean acidification, and rising extreme ocean temperatures, especially in the coral reefs and polar ecosystems, and most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up population rates.

* **At temperature increases of ~4°C or more, the projected risk of decreased food security is very high**
Increased risk that food security will decrease as marine species face redistribution and biodiversity reduction, wheat, rice, and maize in tropical and temperate regions face lower yields, and renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions are depleted.

## The changes to the climate system will result in economic damages across all nations, and if global warming increases past a tipping point, the level of projected damages would be incalculable. The sooner the transition to net zero emissions, the lower the level of damages will be.

## The US is NOT on-track to make significant progress towards to 2050 net zero CO2 emissions target
2020 US Annual CO2 emissions were 4.7 billion tonnes and projected 2050 annual CO2 emissions are estimated between 4 - 5 billion tonnes, resulting in no significant decrease in annual emissions by 2050.  CO2 emissions have reduced by ~14% since 2005, and are projected to decrease from 2022-2037 due primarily from a shift from coal usage to natural gas and renewable usage for electricity generation, but afterwards are projected to increase from 2037-2050 due to population and economic growth increasing the need for energy.

## Epilogue
In summary, it is absolutely critical to transition and decarbonize our industries to become emissions-free as soon as possible in order to prevent catastrophic damages results in climate change. We are currently not on track to make significant progress and require additional decisive action.

The data points above were summarized from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Energy Information Administration.
